#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

# Project Overview: Stage 2

 I use minified files in this project, so in order to see the original ones, check the same folders with corresponding extensions.
 For `css` files go to `css` folder and find `main.css` and `restaurant_info.css`.
 For `js` files go to `js` folder and find `dbhelper.js`, `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js`. You also have `idb.js`, but that's just a library for IndexedDB Promised.
 For `html` files search in root directory for `index_dev.html` and `restaurant_dev.html`
 
 At the moment I use `IndexedDB` to store only the restaurants from the server.
 I have done everything in my powers to improve the performance, but this matter is pretty random and depends heavily on server quality as well as Google Maps.
