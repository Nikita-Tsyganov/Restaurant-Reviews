# Restaurant Reviews

The main project which I have worked on throughout the [Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024).

A restaurant reviews website which provides the restaurants' info such as picture, operating hours, location on Google Maps and reviews with the option to add your own reviews.

For this project, I have incrementally converted a static webpage to a _mobile-ready web application_.
From a static design that lacks accessibility to a design which is _responsive_ on different sized displays and _accessible_ for screen reader use.
I have also implemented a _service worker_, _caching_, _indexedDB_ and _deferred update functionality_ to create a _seamless offline experience_ for the users.

## How to install

### Run a server

##### Running a server is required for the project to work properly

Just go to [this repository](https://github.com/Nikita-Tsyganov/Restaurant-Reviews-Server) and follow the instructions

### Open the website

##### Couldn't be easier

Just click [here](https://nikita-tsyganov.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews/)

Or download the repository and run it from your machine in your favorite fashion (Web Server for Chrome works just fine)
> You will have to use your own Google Maps API Key then though
