# Project Overview: Stage 3

Please, do not use suggested python server to run my project because it simply sucks and affects the performance dramatically.
I use Windows IIS and recommend you to do the same or to pick any other analogue of your choice.
<br>
<br>
I did my best to implement all the required features for stage 3.
<br>
<br>
I have done everything in my powers to improve the performance, but Google Maps won't let me surpass score of 90
(minifying files proved to has little to no impact on performance, but provides additional headaches, so I decided not to go for it)
<br>
<br>
Without Google Maps I have performance score 98 on both index.html and restaurant.html

Here are screenshots with proofs:
