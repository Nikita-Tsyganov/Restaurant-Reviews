#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

# Project Overview: Stage 2

 I use minified files in this project, so in order to see the original ones, check the folder `dist`.
 At the moment I use `IndexedDB` to store only the restaurants from the server.
 I have done everything in my powers to improve the performance, but this matter is pretty random and depends heavily on server quality as well as Google Maps.
